1. Start with an aligned BAM file to a known version of the human reference genome. In this example, we will use GRCh37 human reference genome. This BAM file should be derived from sequencing a real sample or a well characterized reference material. This repository does not provide the BAM file. Please use a BAM file from your laboratory or publicaly available source.
